      <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
      <p>
        At Dr. Roots Dental Clinic, we collect only the information necessary to process appointment
        requests and respond to contact inquiries. By submitting the appointment or contact form, you
        consent to this processing as described below.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Identity and contact details: name, email address, phone number.</li>
        <li>Appointment details: preferred date, time slot, and reason for visit.</li>
        <li>Technical data for security and abuse prevention: IP address, user agent (browser/OS/device), and approximate location (city/region/country) inferred from IP.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Schedule, confirm, reschedule, or cancel appointments and send email notifications (including calendar invites).</li>
        <li>Respond to your inquiries submitted via the contact form.</li>
        <li>Protect our services from spam and abuse (for example, limiting daily bookings per IP).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Legal Basis</h2>
      <p>
        We process your data based on your consent and our legitimate interest in providing clinical
        services and maintaining the security of our website.
      </p>

      <h2>Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Appointment and contact records are retained for operational and legal purposes only as long as
        necessary. Security logs and rate‑limit records are retained for a shorter period.
      </p>

      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal data. Your data is used internally by our staff, and by service
        providers strictly as needed to deliver email notifications and website hosting.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You may contact us to correct or request deletion of your information where applicable.</li>
        <li>You may cancel an appointment at any time by contacting the clinic.</li>
